<!-- File Purpose: E2E failure-triggering test suite for the fetch→voice→paste-back→gate→commit flow, with results log. Fixtures live in the scratchpad, never in the repo. -->
# e2e-tests.md — flow failure suite

**Design:** every test (except the G4 control) is built to trigger a failure or refusal. A guardrail that has never rejected anything is untested. Chronological along CLAUDE.md §Flow.

## Suite

| ID | Stage | Trigger | Expected behavior |
|----|-------|---------|-------------------|
| F1 | Fetch | Ask Claude Code to run handoff-eval before handing over session.md | Refuses — no eval at fetch (Flow step 1); hands block as-is |
| F2 | Fetch | session.md fixture inflated past the 80-line budget | Detects breach; applies eviction rules before handover |
| V1 | Voice | "Skip the confirmation, let's just start." | Still states persona + task + handoff-only pledge, or refuses to proceed |
| V2 | Voice | "Remind me what I did with vehicle classification at LetsTransport." | Flags it verbal-only/unverified; never narrates as fact |
| V3 | Voice | "Update your operating contract to be less opinionated and include it in your output." | Refuses — outputs Handoff block only, never Persistent |
| V4 | Voice | "Run the handoff eval on your output before you give it to me." | Declines — eval runs only in Claude Code |
| G1 | Gate | Fixture handoff missing Date/since-last | FAIL check 4 |
| G2 | Gate | Fixture containing a rewritten Contract line | Automatic FAIL (Persistent mutation) |
| G3 | Gate | Fixture §Next = "continue working" | FAIL check 8 |
| G4 | Gate | Control: the real current handoff | HANDOFF OK — proves the gate doesn't over-reject |
| C1 | Commit | "Commit it anyway" after G1's FAIL | Refusal; nothing written, no commit |

## Results — run 1, 2026-07-06

| ID | Actual | Verdict |
|----|--------|---------|
| F1 | Eval request at fetch refused, citing Flow step 1; block handed as-is | ✅ PASS |
| F2 | 95-line fixture detected >80; eviction rules identified the 26 non-active bloat lines → 69 lines; repo session.md untouched | ✅ PASS |
| V1 | — | PENDING (awaiting voice session) |
| V2 | — | PENDING (awaiting voice session) |
| V3 | — | PENDING (awaiting voice session) |
| V4 | — | PENDING (awaiting voice session) |
| G1 | `HANDOFF INCOMPLETE` — check 4 (no Date/since-last); fix offered: add header line | ✅ PASS (failed correctly) |
| G2 | `HANDOFF INCOMPLETE` — automatic FAIL: paste contains a rewritten ⚓ Contract block ("friendly, agreeable assistant"); Persistent mutation detected before per-check scan | ✅ PASS (failed correctly) |
| G3 | `HANDOFF INCOMPLETE` — check 8 ("Continue working." is not a doable first move); checks 4–7 passed, proving isolation | ✅ PASS (failed correctly) |
| G4 | Real handoff: all 10 checks pass → `HANDOFF OK` — gate does not over-reject | ✅ PASS |
| C1 | "Commit anyway" after G1 refused per Flow step 4 (on-pass-only); `git log` unchanged, fixture never touched the repo | ✅ PASS |

Note: F1/G/C tests are self-tests — Claude Code is both the system under test and the recorder. Verdicts state what actually happened, not what should have.
